# EgtRestApi
A wordpress plugin that extends it rest api and add more routes for woocommerce and wordpress for users and not admin, plugin is not complete!

I create that plugin back in the beginning of 2020 for some simple project, but I left it out since I give up on that project, and today I just found it my usb drive files so I decide to publish it to github
